1. Python version - 3.10.7

2. Hardware configuration - 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 - 1240P / 16GB RAM

2. Run the gen_centrality.py from the terminal using the command : 
    python gen_centrality.py (Windows)
    python3 gen_centrality.py (Linux)

3. The computation for betweenness centrality will take 1.5 hours to 2 hours on a standard PC.

4. The distance between the pair of nodes which are unreachable by directed edges/path has been taken as infinity i.e float('inf')
    E.g. : if there is no directed path from A to B (A -> B) then distance(A, B) = float('inf')
